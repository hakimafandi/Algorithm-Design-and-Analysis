Designed a kruskal without priority que algorithm. to run this code. you insert sample run in input filename: kruskalwithoutpq_a
m_0000006_input.txt. The sample run you can use is in samplerun.txt. After you build and run, you should get the output result in kruskalwithoutpq_am_0000006_output.txt. The result your should get is the same in the samplepoutput.
